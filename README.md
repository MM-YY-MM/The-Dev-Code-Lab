## 🚧 What is this?
Welcome to my **Code Laboratory**. 

This repository is **not** a single coherent project. Instead, it is a collection of:
* Isolated C++ files testing specific concepts.
* Algorithmic challenges and logic drills.
* Raw implementation of ideas (Drafts).
* Refactoring exercises.

Think of this repo as a **sketchbook** where I draw my code ideas freely.

## 🎯 The Purpose
The main goal of `The-Dev-Code-Lab` is to focus on **learning through doing**. Here, I prioritize:
1.  **Understanding Logic:** Breaking down problems without worrying about "production-ready" standards initially.
2.  **Trial & Error:** Testing "what if" scenarios.
3.  **Growth Documentation:** Keeping a history of how I solved small problems over time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Since this is a laboratory:
* You might find **"Spaghetti Code"** here (intentionally left for refactoring later).
* Some files are standalone and might not have a `main` entry point or dependencies.
* Optimization is not always the goal here; **understanding** is.

---

## 📂 Content
You will find various `.cpp` files covering topics like:
* OOP Principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism).
* Data Structures logic.
* File Handling experiments.
* Custom logic for specific problem-solving scenarios.

### 💬 Final Thought
> "Knowledge is not equal to Experience."

This repo represents the **Experience** part—getting my hands dirty with code.
